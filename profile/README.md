# Thiosphere
The frame to all the spaces

A Thiosphere is made from two concentric spheres, using the least number of sides possible, to create a second place to efficiently nurture life. 

Cheap to build yourself with locally sourced materials, or flat packed and shipped to you, each Thiosphere creates a ompact, climate controlled space, isolated from the ground, so it can stay warmer in winter and cooler in the summer.

Two can fit in one parking spot, providing harvests year round, anywhere, with very little energy requirements due to its designed efficiencies, and closed loop ecosystem.

Leveraging aeroponics, community sourced growing knowledge and local consumers; one person, acting like a AirBnB super host, could manage multiple parking spots for local consumers, providing fresh, sustainable and organic produce, without the carbon footprint.
